# RDX

RDX is a rapid development library by ROBLOX developers and for ROBLOX developers. Documentation, convenience, and code readability are RDX's three key
design goals. RDX allows for the rapid prototyping and development of classes and modules through a comprehensive OOP implementation and
hundreds of bug-restricant utility classes. 

## Features

* Prototype-based OOP
* Subclassing
* Function Overloading
* Field Traits (private, protected, virtual, etc)
* Metamethod overrides
* C#-style Properties
